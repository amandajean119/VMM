README FOR PROJECT 3 CODE

Report PDF:

CS523_FinalProjReport_Minnich_Mondragon.pdf

All code is written in Matlab (.m) and C (.h, .c)
 
Open the .m file in Matlab and execute using 'Run' command or UI 'Play' button. Note that this is a graphing program that requires specification of absolute paths to results files, so if you want to run it you need to modify those paths.

We are including C code from 8 of our experiments, plus the smaller version that we plugged in Palacios called palaciosTest.c. We are also including a compiled version of the Palacios version called runme that should be able to run on the UNM CS lab machines, as well as the results from running that file, called chromosomePalaciosTest.txt and fitnessPalaciosTest.txt.

How to Run:

./runme
